# Editor's guide
This document contains the writing and style guide for wiki content. As this project is still evolving, the rules here have not been followed consistently. New or updated content should follow these rules:

## Reviewing new content
* We welcome new content, but should be wary of including inaccurate or unverified information. Editors can generally trust the word of community experts, but their contributions can still benefit from verification before inclusion. Ask for more details if needed.
* Non-trivial information should have multiple eyes on it before merging. This can include the community expert, but pull request reviews by another editor are also helpful.

## Pages and resources system
The `src/content` directory is a _logical_ grouping of content and does not reflect the final URLs that content will be available under, since that is dependent upon the language (see the `slug` property below). I encourage you to explore these directories looking at files to see how pages are already written.

The `page.yml` files within serve as the "skeleton" of the website; each `page.yml` corresponds to a page which gets built. These [YAML][] files contain metadata about the page controlling what features appear on the page, the languages they support, what their localized URL will be, and more. To create a new page, you must create a directory and a corresponding `page.yml` in that directory.

The only required field for a page is its `title`, but I will list all possible fields below to explain their purpose:

```yaml
# The title key is NOT optional, and has no default values. Providing this
# determines which languages the page is generated for. If the title contains
# a ":" be sure to contain the whole title within quotes, e.g. "Halo: CE".
title:
  en: General tools
  es: Herramientas generales
# The "slug" is how this page appears as part of the URL. It defaults to the
# directory name where the page.yml is found, but can be changed per language.
# The slug should always be lowercase and should only contain letters and
# numbers, with no punctuation except for dashes (-) to separate words.
slug:
  es: herramientas-generales
# If provided, the build will fail if this page's logical path does not match
# this value. This can be used for any important pages that the community has
# incoming links to or may have bookmarked.
assertPath: /h1/tools/h1a-ek
# Although page titles, slugs, and body content are indexed for search, you may
# want to boost the page in search results by adding extra keywords. If you find
# that a page isn't showing up at the top of search results when you expect it
# to, try adding some keywords. These are also used for OpenGraph tagging.
keywords:
  en:
    - programs
    - convert
  es:
    - programas
    - convertir
# Related pages show up in the page's sidebar. You must provide the related
# pages as their full logical paths, not their localized URLs. A related page
# link will automatically be added in the opposite direction.
related:
  - /h1/tools
# If provided, this image will be used in the page's info box (aka "metabox").
# It also causes this image to be used in previews when pasting the page into
# social media and Discord. The image file should be in the same directory as
# the page.yml file. This field should be used for images that represent the
# page's topic as an item in a series of pages, similar to Wikipedia's box.
# It should not be used for arbitrary figures, which should use <figure> HTML.
img: tools.jpg
# This caption adds text to the metabox below the image above. It should
# add context to the image or describe anything notable about it. Technically
# optional, but if an image is provided then you should also add a caption.
imgCaption:
  en: Image description
  es: DescripciÃ³n de la imagen
# if provided, adds a text section to the metabox below the caption. This can
# be useful for adding download and other links to tool pages.
info:
  en: >
    You can write **markdown** with:
    * Multiple
    * Lines
  es: Or just one
# Marking a page as a "stub" adds an alert to its header that it's a work in
# progress and also prevents the page from being added to the sitemap (used by
# search bots). Once a page has reached a useful state, remove this flag.
stub: true
# It's important to credit those who discovered something about the engine,
# researched a topic, helped answer questions, or otherwise contributed towards
# a page. Thanked individuals are listed at the bottom of a page, and appear
# in the site-wide thanks summary page.
thanks:
  # Names appear in all languages of the page, but the descriptions may not.
  PersonName:
    en: Researching how to do something
  # Use quotes if the person's name contains spaces.
  "Person Name":
    en: English description of contribution
    es: Spanish description of contribution
# Some pages contain headings which are directly referenced by code in this
# project, e.g. the link to explain group IDs from a tag page's metabox
# title. This YAML config allows a page to expose a stable heading ID alias
# to this code so certain sub-topics can be reliably linked to even if the exact
# wording of a title changes over time or by language. Most pages will not need
# to include this data.
headingRefs:
  group-ids:
    es: id-de-motor
# Identifies this page as a workflow item from workflows.yml, causing workflows
# to be added to the metabox. This can be omitted if either `toolName` or
# `tagName` will be set because they have the same effect, but use this for
# workflow items which are neither tools nor tags (e.g. file formats).
workflowName: obj
# Identifies this page as a tool from workflows.yml. This is very
# similar to using `workflowName` since it also adds workflows to the metabox,
# but it additionally styles the metabox title.
toolName: Sapien
# Identifies this page as a workflow item from workflows.yml similarly to using
# `workflowName`, but also styles the metabox and adds additional info about
# the tag's relationship to other tags. This also causes a tag structure section
# to be added to the page detailing all of its fields, with comments from YAML
# files for each tag type (see `src/data/h1/tags/`). This feature assumes
# Halo 1 tags for now, since that's all we have structure data on.
tagName: scenario
# If true, a section will be added to the page which lists all thanked
# contributors across all pages. This flag is only used on the /thanks summary
# page.
thanksIndex: true
# If provided, adds sections on the page listing all tag types for a particular
# engine version. See `src/data/tags/h1.yml` for an example of source data.
tagIndex:
  game: "h1"
  # Show group IDs column (e.g. "sbsp")
  groupId: true
  # Show parent tag column
  parent: false
  # Disable search links to tag pages (e.g. if they don't exist yet)
  noLink: false
# If true, causes the page to be excluded from the search index. Use this for
# pages which are unlikely to be searched for specifically so they don't
# clutter the results of more typical searches.
noSearch: true
# If true causes the pages to be excluded from the child page listing
# use this for disambiguation/preserving old links
noList: true
# Only used for the 2020 survey results page. Causes survey results to be
# rendered as a section of the page. Survey results are in English only.
surveyResults: true
```

## Markdown files
In addition to having a `page.yml`, each supported language of a page (again, based on presence of localized titles) must have an accompanying [Markdown][] file for body content. The name of the file depends on the language:

* English: `readme.md`
* Spanish: `readme_es.md`

The markdown files contain the main body content of the article and are where most content will be written. Follow the _writing practices_ when writing these files.

Beyond the [basic markdown features][mdbasic], c20 adds a few special extensions and sets configurations:

### Code syntax highlighting
Here's an example of adding syntax highlighting for [code fences][fences]:

```md
    ```python
    scenario_tag = scnr_def.build(filepath=scenario_path)
    ```
```

Beyond styling any of the languages [highlight.js](https://highlightjs.org/) supports, we also implement:

* `hsc` for HaloScript as it would be written for scenarios
* `inittxt` for Halo console commands embedded in an `init.txt`
* `console`, `consoleh1a`, `consoleh2a`, `consoleh3` for Halo console commands entered into the in-game console
* `vrml` for highlighting VRML 1.0 as used in Tool's WRL files

### Tables
We support [Markdown tables][tables], although for larger tables you will want to switch to our custom YAML table extension:

```md
    ```.table
    dataSource: example.yml
    dataPath: example/path
    columns:
      - name: Column 1
        key: subpath
    ```
```

To use the YAML tables extension, create a code fence with the keyword language tag `.table`. Within the code fence you can provide YAML options to specify how the table data is loaded and displayed:

```yaml
# The `dataSource` is optional. If this file is provided, it will be loaded
# and must contain all referenced data to build the table. If it is not
# provided, the table will assume all data comes from the YAML tree under
# `src/data/**/*.yml`.
dataSource: example.yml
# This option can be a single string or a list of strings, each called a "path".
# A path describes how to descend into the data source to reach the iterable
# row data. If multiple are provided, they will be merged into one row set.
# If a path references an array it will be mapped as-is, but if it references an
# object/map then each row will be mapped with a {key, value} structure.
dataPath: hsc/h1/globals/external_globals
# If `id` is provided, it will be used as the prefix for hash-linkable rows.
# It defaults to the last element of the `dataPath`.
id: external_globals
# This option can either be `true` or an integer index. If provided, it enables
# rows to have a clickable hash link so links can be shared that scroll to that
# particular row. If `true`, a special column is added purely for this purpose.
# Otherwise, this specifies a column index which will receive the hash link.
linkCol: 0
# If provided, this overrides the row key used to form the hash link
# (together with the `id` option). It defaults to the key used by the indexed
# column. This key can also contain "/" to descend into an object.
linkSlugKey: slug
# Optional. Adds a CSS class to the table that allows it to exist beside the
# metabox, figures, or other right-floating page content rather than only below.
noClear: true
# Optional. Adds a CSS class that forces table cells with pre-formatted content
# like code to wrap rather than stretching.
wrapPre: true
# If provided, the table rows will be sorted according to the value at this key.
rowSortKey: info/en
# Optional. Reverses the sort direction.
rowSortReverse: true
# If provided, the rows are filtered to just those containing {tags: [example]}.
rowTagFilter: example
# Describes the columns of the table and how to get their data from rows
columns:
    # The text shown in the column's head cell. This can be markdown too.
  - name: Description
    # The path within the iterable row for this column's value.
    key: info/en
    # Supported cell formats are: text, code, anchor, and codeblock. Defaults
    # to text if not provided.
    format: text
    # Optional. Allows you to provide inline CSS for the <th>.
    style: "width: 50%"
  # and more columns...
```

### Alert boxes
An alert box is a highlighted container which draws attention to some content, usually text. It can be added with the following syntax:

```md
    ```.alert info
    Alert body here, in **markdown**.
    ```
```

The possible alert types are `info`, `danger`, and `success`.

### Data structure tables
You can generate data structure documentation tables from a YAML description like so:

```md
    ```.struct
    entry_type: Savegame
    showOffsets: true
    id: savegame
    imports:
      h1/files/savegame.bin:
        - Savegame
    ```
```

The type definitions can be provided inline or imported from `src/data/structs/*`. The YAML content within the code fence follows this format:
```yaml
# determines the "main" structure
entry_type: Savegame
# if provided, shows offsets in table
showOffsets: true
# root for HTML ID generation
id: savegame
# you can specify modules to load from `data/structs/...` which contain types
imports:
  <module>:
    - <Type>
# definitions for type names, optional
typeDefs:
  DifficultyOpts:
    # type classes can be enum, bitfield, or struct
    class: enum
    # enum size in bytes, also used for bitfield
    size: 1
    # for enums specifically, each value's name
    options:
      - name: easy
      - name: normal
      - name: hard
      - name: legendary

  Savegame:
    class: struct
    # both struct and bitfield classes have fields
    fields:
      # an intrinsic resizable padding type
      - type: pad
        size: 0x1E2
      # referencing the enum above
      - name: last difficulty
        type: DifficultyOpts
      - type: pad
        size: 5
      # undefined types assumed intrinsic
      - name: last played scenario
        type: char
        count: 32
        # multi-language markdown comment support
        comments:
          en: >
            An ASCII-encoded [scenario][] tag path, null-terminated and 32
            characters max. An example value is `levels\b30\b30` for The Silent
            Cartographer.
```

### Figures and videos
* Right-aligned figures are added using a special `.figure` tag in markdown images:
  ```md
      ![.figure Figure caption markdown](figure.jpg)
  ```
* A markdown image which ends with `.mp4`, e.g. `![](video.mp4)`, will generate `<video>` tags with the correct source and poster image. The wiki's build automatically generates poster images from the first video frame (requires `ffmpeg`).
* Standard markdown images are automatically enclosed in an anchor tag which opens the image in another tab.

### Smart links
Smart links are perhaps the most important feature of c20's markdown. Since most of the links you'll be creating will be to other wiki pages, it would be both cumbersome and fragile to specify the full path of that page every time. We extend [standard reference-style links][reflink] with an automatic lookup mechanism when a reference is not defined.

For example, if you just write a link like `[the scenario tag][scenario]`, c20 will automatically resolve the target URL as `/h1/tags/scenario` without you having to define it. You can also include a heading ID like `scenario#tag-field-bipeds`. The lookup is based on the page's _logical path_ (the name of its directories under `src/content/` rather than its localized URL). When multiple target pages match, c20 will choose the one _most related_ to the origin page in the content tree. When this is not possible, the ambiguity must be clarified by specifying more of the logical path in the link: `[Halo 2 tags][h2/tags]` or `[Halo 1 tags][h1/tags]`.

### Other Markdown features
* Inline HTML is supported for anything not covered through markdown or c20's features. Be careful not to accidentally write text which would be interpreted as HTML tags (e.g. when writing command line or HSC usage docs).
* All headings automatically get anchor links/IDs for linking directory to that heading. When someone loads a page with that heading ID in the URL (e.g. `#my-heading`) the page will automatically scroll to that content. Do not make headings which are also links (like `# [Heading text](www.example.com)`), as it's unsupported.

## Resources
The directory for a page can include other files related to that topic, like images. Simply place images in the page's directory and they will be copied for each localized output URL. If an image is only applicable to a certain language because it contains text in that language, you can add a suffix like `screenshot_es.jpg` or `screenshot_en.jpg` and it will only be copied to certain language outputs. **Do not** place images in a subdirectory for organization; subdirectories should be used for child pages only.

If you include `.dot` files, they will be automatically rendered to diagrams using [Graphviz](https://graphviz.org/).

Any `src/content/../todo.md` file or `src/content/../todo` directory is git-ignored and can be used to mock out page structures and keep notes for later writing.

## Data files
Some wiki content is better described as structured data rather than markdown. These files can be found under `src/data/...` and are used by the various wiki features above to automatically generate content or serve as table data.

* `hsc`: contains definitions for script functions and globals by game
* `structs`: contains type definitions for data structure tables
* `tags`: lists tags and their purpose for each game
* `workflows`: describes modding tools and resources and how they interact

## Writing practices
### Content organization
* All CE-specific content should live under the `h1` tree, whereas tools topics which could apply to multiple games should live under the `general` tree.
* If a topic is only really related to another topic, ensure it is either a child page (a subdirectory) or under heading of that parent topic instead.
* If a topic is growing too large, consider splitting it up and taking its large sections to a child page (a subdirectory).
* Child pages expand upon the topic of a parent.

### Markdown tips
* Ordered and unordered list items should not have empty lines between them, or else it will not be considered a proper list by the parser.

### Writing style
* All headings in a markdown document start at H1 (a single "#") and sub-headings must never skip a level; you can't have an H3 follow an H1.
* Titles use sentence case, with the first word capitalized only. The exception is if the title or parts of it are a proper noun like a person's name.
* In-universe proper nouns or nicknames should be capitalized, like Warthog.
* When referencing tag types, use their file name extensions rather than group IDs. When mentioning them without a hyperlink, style them with italic _emphasis_.
* When referring to tag fields, style them with italic _emphasis_.
* When stating raw data values and offsets, use `code` tags.
* Blocks of Halo script should use the `hsc` language. Blocks of console commands should use `console`. This ensures proper syntax highlighting.
* Use **strong** tags when naming a page's topic for the first time in the introduction paragraph. The exception is pages which are not about a specific "thing" or concept.
* Buttons presses should be documented like `<kbd>Ctrl</kbd> + <kbd>A</kbd>`.
* There is no strong preference at this time for UK/Canada vs. US spelling of words like colour, unless you are referring to a tag's field name which should match exactly.
* Don't assume the reader knows anything about modding Halo. You don't have to detail literally every step, but include links to prerequisite information and other pages to fill out concepts. Use examples that the reader might be familiar with to help get your points across.
* Avoid using words like "below" or "above" to refer to other content on the page unless it is fairly certain the content will stay together. We may wish to reorder sections and paragraphs in the future. Consider using an anchor link to point users to relevant sections if they aren't immediately obvious.
* Use a "textbook" style of writing rather than conversational. Keep writing concise and avoid expressions which may confuse readers whose first language is not English.
* Image alt attributes should aid the reader in the case that images _don't_ load. For example, `![The Modeling tab is at the top of the editor window](image.jpg)`.
* Use ordered and unordered lists sparingly. They should be used for small, easily-digestible lists of things but not listing paragraphs of steps in a guide.

### Commonly-used headings
To maintain consistency across pages, try to use some of these heading names if relevant:

* Known issues
* Limits
* Related script functions and globals
* Compatibility
* Troubleshooting
* Installation
* Usage
* Appendix

### Linking
* Add hyperlinks where it is helpful for the reader, but avoid over-linking especially when there is already the same link visible within a short scrolling distance on the same page.
* Avoid orphaned content. Every new page should have at least one link to it from other relevant locations.
* Links from one page to another usually need one in reverse too.
* If a tag page has a dedicated section describing a certain concept, prefer linking to that over linking to the relevant fields in the tag structure.
