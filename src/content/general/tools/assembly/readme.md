**Assembly** is a cache editing tool that can be used to mod various Halo games from the 360 to MCC. This can be a neat way for quickly testing a feature by modifying game values in real time. A user can also save changes permanently to a cache file without the need to recompile the .map file in the editing kit. Support for certain features depends on the Halo game being modified.
