**3D Studio Max** (or just **Max**) is a 3D computer graphics program that can be used to modeling, unwrap, rig, and animate assets for Halo.

Max is the classic 3D software documented in the [HEK][] tutorial, and for many years was the only tool with exporters available for Halo 1 and 2. The free version, [Gmax][], is also viable but lacks many features of the paid product and was discontinued in 2005.
