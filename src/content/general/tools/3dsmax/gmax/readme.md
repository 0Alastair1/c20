**Gmax** is a freeware version of [3ds Max][3dsmax] with a limited feature set intended for game content creation: modeling, texturing, animating, and basic materials. Although officially discontinued in 2005, 3D content website TurboSquid still maintains a download mirror.

The MAXScript plugins [Chimp][] and [Bluestreak][] (compact versions of scripts) can be used to export [JMS][] files from Gmax.
