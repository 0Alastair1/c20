Blender is a free and open-source 3D modeling, animating, and rendering toolset. While it has always been possible to transfer assets between 3D software, Blender is a relative newcomer to direct Halo modding workflows, which traditionally relied on the closed-source paid [3ds Max][3dsmax], thanks to community-made plugins.

Note that modern Blender 2.8+ is the preferred version, as this will work with available exporters.
