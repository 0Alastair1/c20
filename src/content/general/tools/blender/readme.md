**Blender** is a free and open-source 3D modeling, animating, and rendering toolset. While it has always been possible to transfer assets between 3D software, Blender is a relative newcomer to direct Halo modding workflows, which traditionally relied on the closed-source paid [3ds Max][3dsmax]. Thanks to [community-made plugins][halo-asset-blender-development-toolset], it is now possible to use Blender exclusively.

Note that modern Blender 2.8+ is the preferred version, as this will work with available exporters.
