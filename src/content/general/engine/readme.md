All games in the Halo series use some generation of Bungie's in-house proprietary **Blam!** engine. Each generation added new capabilities and had systems overhauled, but one of its defining characteristics is the [tags system](~h1/tags) used for managing resources.

For details on each generation see pages dedicated to them:
- [H1 Engine](~h1/engine)
- [H2 Engine](~h2/engine)
- [H3 Engine](~h3/engine)
