The **Amalgam Scene Specification** (ASS) file format is a text-based intermediate representation of model data which can be compiled into tag formats using [H2][h2-tool] and [H3 Tool][h3-tool]. It is the successor to [JMS][], though JMS is still supported past H1.

ASS is exported from 3D editors like [Blender][] and [3ds Max][3dsmax] using add-ons or converted from [MCC FBX][fbx] using Tool.
