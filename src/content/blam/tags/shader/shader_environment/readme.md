Environment shaders are intended for opaque surfaces in [BSPs][scenario_structure_bsp]. A key feature of this shader is its ability to blend between two detail maps, making it ideal for outdoor ground shaders. It also supports cubemaps and masked specularity which can be used for metallic surfaces like Forerunner structures.
