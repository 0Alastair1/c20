Water shaders are characterized by their use of layered animated _ripple maps_, tint colours, and reflectance.

They need not exclusively be used for water -- the coolant pools of _Keyes_ (d20) also use water shaders, and the [Halo CE Refined][refined] project uses them for some glass to better emulate Xbox glass shaders. They are also not exclusively used within the [BSP][scenario_structure_bsp], with [skies][sky] like _Damnation's_ also using this shader type.

Water shaders are **not** typically used for waterfalls ([shader_transparent_chicago_extended][]) nor rivers ([shader_transparent_chicago][]), though there are exceptions (the water in _Battle Creek_).
