Tags are the fundamental unit of resources which comprise a [map][]. They come in many different types, each with a predefined structure and data fields. Tags can reference other tags by their _tag path_, forming a tree-like structure of all resources necessary to compile a map.

The name "tag" was inspired by [XML tags][about-xml], which also have types and a structure with fields.

# Tag paths
Tags are referenced by their tag path, which can be thought of like their "URL". An example would be:

```
levels\test\tutorial\tutorial.scenario_structure_bsp
```
