Machines are used for objects like doors, elevators, light bridges, and the engine covers in _The Maw_. These objects have open and closed states and the unique capability of conveying bipeds which stand upon them while they move, like vehicles and other bipeds in later Halo games.

The state of machines are not synchronized over Halo's multiplayer netcode, so it is not adviseable to include them in multiplayer maps. However, because [biped][] deaths are synchronized, some map makers have resorted to scripted ["biped crushers"][biped-crusher] rooms as a workaround, where a biped's living/dead state determines if a door is open or closed.
