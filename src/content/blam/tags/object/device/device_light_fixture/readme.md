Light fixtures are a type of static object whose light can be enabled or disabled dynamically (e.g. by script or by [device_control][]). They can also just be used to decorate and illuminate [light maps][scenario_structure_bsp#lightmaps].

A unique feature of light fixtures is that [projectiles][projectile] like bullets will collide with them, but [units][unit] like the player will not.
