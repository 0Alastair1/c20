Bipeds are the AI- and player-driven characters found in campaign and multiplayer maps. They can take on a wide range of forms, like the typical enemies and allies seen in the campaign, scripted characters like Cortana, and even invisible AI controlling dropship turrets or detecting explosive damage to the ship's reactor in _The Maw_.

Bipeds are a type of _Unit_.
