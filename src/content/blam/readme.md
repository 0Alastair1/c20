## Other games
The Blam! engine was not just used for the Halo series. Bungie co-founder [Alex Seropian][alex] went on to found [Wideload Games][wideload] and used the engine for [Stubbs the Zombie in Rebel Without a Pulse][stubbs]. In fact, it is possible to extract [tags][] from Stubbs using [Refinery][mek] and recompile levels for Halo.

Another lesser-known use was in [prototyping Shadowrun gameplay][shadowrun-prototype] while its own engine was under development.
