Welcome to **c20**, a project which aims to document the immense tribal knowledge of the [Halo 1][h1] modding community, focusing primarily on _Halo: Custom Edition_. C20 will cover [engine details][blam], the [Halo Editing Kit][hek], community tools, and guides for custom content creation.

**This resource is still a work in progress, so expect improvements over time.**

# What is modding?
_Modding_ is the modification of a game by its players. This can include unofficial bug fixes, new content, and changes to existing content.

# Why mod Halo?
Halo 1 was released in 2001 and has a relatively small player base, especially outside MCC. Major engines like _Unity_, _Source_, _Creation Engine_, and _Unreal_ have larger communities, more tooling, and more features. Why might someone choose to mod Halo 1?

* Halo's retro art style means you can focus on fundamentals; maps and other custom assets don't require high visual fidelity. The game lends itself well to hobby modding, or as a gateway into more feature-rich engines.
* Halo's engine is highly data-driven by its [tags system][tags], which can be used to customize nearly any aspect of the game. Make basic twists on gameplay, author entirely new singleplayer campaigns, or follow your interests on anything in-between. It may not be as powerful as modern engines, but it still offers plenty of customization within Halo's limits.
* Tags and Halo's existing system make it quick and easy get content in-game. Some other engines require a lot of work to build a playable shooter as a base.
* It's an opportunity to connect with others who share your interests or nostalgia for a great game. Knowledge sharing and collaborative work are staples of this community.
