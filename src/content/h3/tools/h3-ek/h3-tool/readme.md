**H3-Tool** (**tool.exe**), is a [command-line][] utility used to compile data into [tags][], and tags into [maps][map]. It was released as a part of the [Halo 3 Editing Kit][h3-ek] by 343 Industries in 2021.

# Conventions used in this article

- `<arg>` - refers to a mandatory argument.
- `[arg]` - refers to an optional argument (you can omit these).
- parentheses appended to the `arg` name are used to encode valid argument values.
- `arg(option1, option2)` - Either `option1` or `option2` can be passed as `arg`.
- `arg(optionClass)` - Any value of `optionClass` can be used.
- `Tool` or `tool.exe` - refers to the subject of this article, the H2C Tool, if the legacy Tool is being referred to that will be made explicit.

# Command line flags
- `-data_dir` and `-tags_dir` can be used to change the data and tag directories respectively. This might not work with all verbs as it's experimental. See [using custom content paths][using-custom-content-paths].
- `-pause` wait for user input before exiting, useful for custom launchers.
