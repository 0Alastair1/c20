**H3 Guerilla** (`guerilla.exe`) is part of the [Halo 3 Editing Kit][h3-ek], is a visual [tag][tags] editor. Although it can visualize [bitmaps][bitmap] and is primarily focused on editing and viewing the structured fields which comprise tags. It does not offer ingame previews or interactive placement of [objects][object], which is [Sapien's][H3-Sapien] role.

# Saved workspaces
Using _File > Save/Load Workspace_, you can save and reload a file which contains the current state of open tags and their window positions.

# Explorer bar
A file hierarchy of your tag directory. It does not update in real time so refresh it with F5 if you need to. First seen in [Halo 2 Vista's Guerilla][h2v-guerilla] and [Halo 2 MCC's Guerilla][H2-Guerilla]
