Like earlier games, Halo 2 supports **scripting** with [HaloScript][general/engine/scripting].

# Operators and keywords
```.table
dataPath: hsc/h3/ops_keywords/operators_and_keywords
linkCol: true
linkSlugKey: slug
columns:
  - key: info/en
    name: Expression
    format: text
```

# Functions
Since H2 documentation will be an ongoing work-in-progress, please refer to the more complete [H1 scripting page][h1/engine/scripting] for info on common functions.

```.table
dataPath: hsc/h3/functions/functions
linkCol: true
linkSlugKey: slug
rowSortKey: slug
columns:
  - key: info/en
    name: Function
    format: text
```

# External globals
A list of globals has not yet been generated for H3, since its `script_doc` function does not output them as of season 8. It is likely to share many in common with [H2][h2/engine/scripting#external-globals]
