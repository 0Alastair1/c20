This website is edited and maintained by [Sigmmma][], comprised of gbMichelle, Mimickal (Donut), and Conscars.

Firstly, we would like to thank the developers and maintainers of Halo over the years, including Bungie, Gearbox Software, Saber Interactive, and 343 Industries. These studios brought this game to life and to new platforms for years to come, and they created (and improved!) the editing kits that fostered the modding community.

Secondly, most of the community's knowledge comes from the hard work of members who have researched, reverse engineered, experimented, and documented over the years. Our current understanding is built on a mountain of documents, forum posts, tutorials, and conversations. While we can't include everyone, we would at least like to thank the following people for researching and documenting specific topics included here on c20:

## Thank you!
