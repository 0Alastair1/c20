_The Reclaimers Library_ is a project which aims to capture the Halo CE modding community's knowledge in one place. Think of it like an extended HEK tutorial, but not restricted to the HEK. There's a lot of ground to cover, which is why we need your help prioritizing content.

For example, have you always wanted to make custom vehicles but never knew how? Can't wrap your head around portals, or the mysteries of scripting? Or are you curious about modding MCC H1, H2, or H3?

By completing the below survey, we'll know what to focus on documenting. Don't forget to hit **Submit** at the bottom of the page!
