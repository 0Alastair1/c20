The **Jointed Model Skeleton** (JMS) file format is used as an intermediate geometry format when exporting from 3D editors like [Blender][] and [3ds Max][3dsmax], and after conversion from FBX using [H1A Tool][h1a-tool]. Using [Tool][h1a-tool], a JMS file can be compiled into Halo's geometry tags:

* [gbxmodel][]
* [model_collision_geometry][]
* [physics][]
* [scenario_structure_bsp][]
