The **Jointed Model Skeleton** (JMS) file format is used as an intermediate geometry format when exporting from 3D editors like [Blender][] and [3ds Max][3dsmax]. Using [Tool][], a JMS file can be compiled into Halo's geometry tags:

* [gbxmodel][]
* [model_collision_geometry][]
* [physics][]
* [scenario_structure_bsp][]
