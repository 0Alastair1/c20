The **Jointed Model Skeleton** (JMS) file format is used as an intermediate geometry format when exporting from 3D editors like [Blender][] and [3ds Max][3dsmax]. Using [Tool][], a JMS file can be compiled into geometry tags: [gbxmodel][], [model_collision_geometry][] and [scenario_structure_bsp][].
