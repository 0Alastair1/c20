Antenna tags are an object _widget_ representing a springy series of vertices rendered with a [bitmap][] texture which can be attached to [object][] markers. They are only used on the Warthog and Scorpion vehicles, but during Halo's development they were also present on the Spartan (cyborg) [biped][].

# Limits
Only 12 antennas can be simulated at once. Extra antennas in the map will not be rendered.
