Antenna tags are an object _widget_ representing a springy series of vertices rendered with a [bitmap](~) texture which can be attached to [object](~) markers. They are only used on the Warthog and Scorpion vehicles, but during Halo's development they were also present on the Spartan (cyborg) [biped](~).

# Limits
The [game state](~game-state) has limited space for simulated antennas (12 in legacy, 24 in H1A). Extra antennas in the map will not be rendered.
