The model tag contains the render model and [shader_model] references for [objects][object] such as [vehicles][vehicle], [scenery][], and [weapons][weapon] among others. It is not collideable nor animated on its own, and objects may reference additional [model_collision_geometry][] and [model_animations][] tags.

**This tag is specific to Halo 1 for Xbox**, while the [gbxmodel][] tag is the equivalent for the PC port and its derivatives like MCC. Unlike a Gearbox model, this version contains compressed vertices.
