**Weapons** are most commonly seen as the wieldable items dropped by enemies and found in the environment. However, they are also used for items like the CTF flag, oddball, and weapons attached to [vehicles][vehicle].

Weapons are intended to fire instances of the [projectile][] tag, but they can technically reference any [object][] (spawning bipeds, for example). Thrown grenades are not a type of weapon, but rather a projectile referenced by [globals][].
