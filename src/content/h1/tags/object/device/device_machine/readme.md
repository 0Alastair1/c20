**Machines** are used for objects like doors, elevators, light bridges, and the engine covers in _The Maw_. These objects have open and closed states and the unique capability of conveying [bipeds][biped] which stand upon them while they move.

The states of machines are not synchronized over Halo's multiplayer [netcode][], so it is not adviseable to include them in multiplayer maps unless they are automatic doors (which are just based on player proximinity) or use a [synchronization workaround][sync-workarounds].
