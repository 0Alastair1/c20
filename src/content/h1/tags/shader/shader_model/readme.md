The shader_model tag is used for opaque materials on [object models][gbxmodel]. It supports features like map animation, detail maps, specularity, self-illumination, and colour change (e.g. for armour ranks/teams).

Singleplayer units have their colors set in their [actor_variant][] tags. In multiplayer, players' armor colors are [hard-coded][hard-coded-data#multiplayer-armor-colors].
