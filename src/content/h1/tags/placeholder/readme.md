The placeholder tag is a simple [object][] exclusively used by the [Sapien][] editor for interactive markers (not to be confused with [model markers][gbxmodel#markers]). Placeholders can reference a [gbxmodel][] for their appearance.

Sapien will not load without placeholder tags being present under the tag path `ui/editor/markers`. These tags come with the [HEK's][hek] default tagset.
