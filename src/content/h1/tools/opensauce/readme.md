**OpenSauce** (often just "**OS**") is a mod for Halo Custom Edition and its editing kit. It enhances the in-game experience with customization and engine extensions, but also offers modified versions of the HEK tools for more extensive modding of the game. It is mostly used as the base for experimental maps and singleplayer overhaul mods like CMT's SPV3.
