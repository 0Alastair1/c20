The **Halo Editing Kit** or **HEK** is the official suite of modding tools released by Gearbox Software alongside [Halo: Custom Edition][h1]. The kit consists of modified versions of Bungie's own internal development tools and includes a [tutorial][hek-tut] and commonly used _data_ and [tags][] for map development.

In 2021, the HEK was updated and rereleased as the [H1A Editing Kit][h1a-ek].
