After installing the HEK, Windows users must [prevent the Virtual Store from interfering with it](~tips#windows-virtual-store).

The **Halo Editing Kit** or **HEK** is the official suite of modding tools released by Gearbox Software alongside [Halo: Custom Edition](~h1). The kit consists of modified versions of Bungie's own internal development tools and includes a [tutorial][hek-tut] and commonly used _data_ and [tags](~) for map development.

In 2021, the HEK was updated and rereleased as the [H1A Editing Kit](~h1a-ek).
