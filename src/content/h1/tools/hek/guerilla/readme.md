**Guerilla** is a visual [tag][tags] editor. Although it can visualize [bitmaps][bitmap] and play sounds, it is primarily focused on editing and viewing the structured fields which comprise tags. It does not offer in-game previews or interactive placement of [objects][object], which is [Sapien's][sapien] role.

# Saved workspaces
Using _File > Save/Load Workspace_, you can save and reload a file which contains the current state of open tags and their window positions. Guerilla automatically creates a file `guerilla.cfg` with the last window state when closed.

# Known issues
The "Show HUD" window for [unit_hud_interface][] tags does not work as intended.
