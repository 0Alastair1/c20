Invader is an [open source][invader-repo] modding toolkit for Halo 1, supporting multiple [editions][h1#editions-and-versions] depending on the tool. It aims to replace tools of the [HEK][hek] with an emphasis on tag data correctness and validation. Most of its tools are [command-line][] operated like [Tool][], although _invader-edit-qt_ is a GUI tag editor similar to [Guerilla][] and _Six Shooter_ is a GUI wrapper for some invader tools.

```.alert
Familiarity with the [command-line][] is a prerequisite for most of
Invader's tools if you are not using _Six Shooter_.
