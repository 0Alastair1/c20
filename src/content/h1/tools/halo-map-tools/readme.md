**Halo Map Tools (HMT)** was a direct [map](~h1/map) editor, injector, and asset extractor supporting H1X and H1PC (including PC beta and demo). It was one of the community's earliest modding tools and was used to create modded map files by editing data within a map rather than compiling a map from source tags, albeit with limited support for [tags](~h1/tags). It can extract and inject textures, sounds, and models.

Although you may see HMT referenced in older forum posts or guides, you should avoid using it these days. Using [invader](~) to extract tags and recompile them into maps is a more powerful and supported workflow.
