Rec0's physics importer allows for [mass points][physics#mass-points] to be imported into [3ds Max][3dsmax]. It does not retain node hierarchies and is mainly intended for visualization and learning rather than for re-exporting to [JMS][].

# Usage
From [Guerilla][], use the `File > Export` option to save the tag in text format. From Max, use `MaxScript > Run script` to run the importer and select the text file.
