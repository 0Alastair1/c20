**SparkEdit** is a direct [map](~) editor for H1PC. It features a scenario editor/viewer where users can place and modify objects. In this way it is similar to [Sapien](~).

{% alert type="danger" %}
Although you may see HMT referenced in older forum posts or guides, you should avoid using it these days. Using [invader](~) to extract tags and recompile them into maps is a more powerful and supported workflow.
