Guerilla is a visual [tag][tags] editor. Although it can visualize [bitmaps][bitmap] and play sounds, it is primarily focused on editing and viewing the structured fields which comprise tags. It does not offer ingame previews or interactive placement of [objects][object], which is [Sapien's][h1a-sapien] role.

It is rumored that Guerilla was created later in Halo's development and tags may have previously been edited using something like [Tool][h1a-tool], possibly leading to some of the [invalid tag data][tags#invalid-data] seen in the game's maps.

# Saved workspaces
Using _File > Save/Load Workspace_, you can save and reload a file which contains the current state of open tags and their window positions. Guerilla automatically creates a file `guerilla.cfg` with the last window state when closed.

# Changes from legacy Guerilla
If you are used to the legacy tools here is a quick primer on what's changed, if you are new to halo modding you can skip this section.

A few features have been backported from Halo 2.

- Tag blocks can now be collapsed.
- UI elements have been upgraded to look more modern.
- *Expert mode* and *Show tag block sizes* options.
- A zoom level feature has been added to the bitmap viewer.

Some errors have also been fixed and the some unused UI options have been removed.
