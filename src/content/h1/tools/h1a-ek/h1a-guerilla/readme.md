This is an article about the H1A Guerilla for use with MCC, for the legacy Guerilla for [Halo: Custom Edition][h1] see [Guerilla][]. You may also be interested in a [summary of changes][h1a-ek#guerilla] from legacy Guerilla.

**H1A Guerilla** is a visual [tag][tags] editor. Although it can visualize [bitmaps][bitmap] and play sounds, it is primarily focused on editing and viewing the structured fields which comprise tags. It does not offer ingame previews or interactive placement of [objects][object], which is [Sapien's][h1a-sapien] role.

# Saved workspaces
Using _File > Save/Load Workspace_, you can save and reload a file which contains the current state of open tags and their window positions. Guerilla automatically creates a file `guerilla.cfg` with the last window state when closed.

# Using a custom tags path

See [using custom content paths][using-custom-content-paths], you only need to set a tags directory as Geurilla doesn't use the data folder. It should work without any major issues.
