The **CAD animation exporter** for 3ds Max and Gmax allows all types of [animations][animation-data] to be exported from a rigged scene. It features IK (inverse kinematics) support, biped support, and batch exporting from multiple scenes.

# Usage
From Max's menu, use `MAXScript > Run Script` to select the extracted `.mse` script, or the unencrypted `.ms`. The "compact" script is for use in Gmax only.

The script was originally written for 3ds Max 7 and 2008 and may not be compatible with modern or future versions.
