The **Blender .gbxmodel importer** is an add-on for **Blender 2.7** which can import [gbxmodel][] tags.

```.alert danger
Since this add-on was written for Blender 2.7, users of modern Blender 2.8+ should instead use [Blendkrieg][] or the combination of [Reclaimer][] and [Jointed Model Blender Toolset][jointed-model-blender-toolset] with [JMS][].
