The **Blender .gbxmodel importer** was an add-on for **Blender 2.7** which can import [gbxmodel](~) tags.

{% alert type="danger" %}
This importer has been made obsolete. [Halo Asset Blender Development Toolset](~halo-asset-blender-development-toolset) now supports importing tags and works in current versions of Blender.
