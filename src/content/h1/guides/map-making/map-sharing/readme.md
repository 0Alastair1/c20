Ready to share your [map][] with others? Most map files are self-contained and can be shared freely. Maps which rely on custom resource maps need to be distributed with those resource maps too, which is more common for complete campaign overhaul mods.

# Pre-release checklist
* Have you left [enough spare tag space][map#limits] in your map so players using other languages can avoid crashes?
* Have you supported all intended gametypes by placing the appropriate _netgame flags_ in [Sapien][]?
* Does your map rely on non-standard [resource maps][map#resource-maps] which need to be included?

# Release websites
These community-run websites host map downloads:

* http://halomaps.org/ (archive only, no longer processing submissions)
* https://haloce3.com/
* https://opencarnage.net/

## HaloNet
The [HaloNet.net map repository][halonet-repo] is a large resource of downloadable Halo maps which supports automatic map downloads by client mods like HAC2 and [Chimera][]. Mods can use the [Map Download Protocol][halonet-dl] to automatically retrieve maps when the player joins a server and does not have the map previously downloaded. See the [submission guidelines][halonet-submit] for instructions uploading your map to this repository.
