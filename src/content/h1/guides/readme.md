# General techniques
Modding knowledge tends to be pretty spread out, and the official [HEK][] tutorial covers only the most basic map-making process. While this library, community tutorials, and chat channels help to fill the gaps, there often isn't specific information available. Some techniques you can use to find answers are:

## Use the community
With Halo's long history of modding, odds are someone has at least talked  about what you need. Try searching for past discussions on community websites and [Discord channels][discord] and asking for help. Authors of well-known maps, tags, tools, and assets may be available to contact directly and explain their techniques.

## Learn by example
Are there any existing maps which do what you need? Extracting tags with [Refinery][mek] is a great way to understand existing solutions which may not be documented in tutorial format, but are nonetheless available to study.

## Tag data analysis and manipulation
Many tag fields are still poorly understood. Using [Reclaimer][], tags can be analyzed in bulk and edited programmatically to get a better idea of how changes affects the game.
