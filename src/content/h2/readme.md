**Halo 2** is the second installment of the _Halo_ franchise and sequel to [Halo 1][h1]. It was originally released for the classic Xbox, but has since been ported to PC twice with _Halo 2 Vista_ and _MCC_, and to Xbox One with _Halo 2 Anniversary_.

# Modding
Modding of Halo 2 is supported with the [Halo 2 Editing Kit][h2ek], and community tools like _Assembly_ and [Jointed Model Blender Toolset][jointed-model-blender-toolset]. **[Project Cartographer][cartographer]** is a popular mod of the original H2V port which restores online play and adds additional features.

Like Halo 1, Halo 2's [tags][] play a large role in modding.
