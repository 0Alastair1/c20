After installing the H2V-EK, Windows users must [prevent the Virtual Store from interfering with it][tips#windows-virtual-store].

The **Halo 2 Editing Kit**, or **Halo 2 Vista Editing Kit (H2V-EK)** as it's referred to on this wiki to disambiguate it from the newer [H2-EK][h2-ek], is the official suite of modding tools released by Hired Gun alongside the [Halo 2 Vista][h2] port in 2007.

The kit consists of cut down versions of Bungie's own internal development tools, a tutorial, and commonly used _data_ and [tags][] for map development. Because the tools are so limited in functionality compared to their internal counterparts, or even the [HEK][], community mods like [H2Codez](https://github.com/Project-Cartographer/H2Codez) were created to expand modding capabilities.
