**H2V Guerilla**, part of the [H2V-EK](~), is a visual [tag](~tags) editor. Although it can visualize [bitmaps](~bitmap) and play sounds, it is primarily focused on editing and viewing the structured fields which comprise tags. It does not offer ingame previews or interactive placement of [objects](~object), which is [Sapien's](~h2v-sapien) role.

# Saved workspaces
