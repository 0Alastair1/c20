H2Guerilla, part of the [H2V-EK][], is a visual [tag][tags] editor. Although it can visualize [bitmaps][bitmap] and play sounds, it is primarily focused on editing and viewing the structured fields which comprise tags. It does not offer ingame previews or interactive placement of [objects][object], which is [H2Sapien's][H2Sapien] role.

# Saved workspaces
Using _File > Save/Load Workspace_, you can save and reload a file which contains the current state of open tags and their window positions.
