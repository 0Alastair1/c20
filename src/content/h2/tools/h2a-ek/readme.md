The **Halo 2 Classic Editing Kit** or **H2CEK** is the official suite of modding tools released by 343i, the tools are based off the internal tools used by Bungie and then 343i with some improvements ported over
from the [H2V-EK][] which was heavily cut down but included some usability and stability improvements.

The tools include many improvements over H2Codez enhanced H2EK, most notably:

* Sounds can be imported directly instead of using the CE upgrade pipeline.
* Render models can be created without using the BSP conversion method or third-party tools.
* A standalone build similar in function to H1A standalone.
* Fully functional player simulation.
* Better overall stability.
* AI functionality in [Sapien][h2c-sapien].

# Changelog from H2V tools
* Tools are not stripped down, you can create models, animations, different types of textures, sounds and more!
* Tools have been upgraded to DX11 from the now obsolete DX9.
* You can create and edit all tag types in [Guerilla][h2c-guerilla]
