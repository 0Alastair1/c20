Guerilla, part of the [Halo 2 Anniversary Editing Kit][H2A-EK], is a visual [tag][tags] editor. Although it can visualize [bitmaps][bitmap] and play sounds, it is primarily focused on editing and viewing the structured fields which comprise tags. It does not offer ingame previews or interactive placement of [objects][object], which is [Sapien's][H2C-Sapien] role.

# Saved workspaces
Using _File > Save/Load Workspace_, you can save and reload a file which contains the current state of open tags and their window positions.

# Explorer bar
A new feature in Halo 2 is to show a file hierarchy of your tag directory. It does not update in real time so refresh it with F5 if you need to.
