The [Halo 3 ODST Editing Kit][H3ODST-EK] includes a **standalone build** of that game (**atlas_tag_test.exe**). This build doesn't include network functionality and it intended for testing single-player maps. It includes AI debugging code not included in other published builds of the engine.

```.alert danger
The standalone build is configured differently from the retail build of Halo 3 ODST that's part of MCC - bugs or features found in one might not be found in the other. For that reason maps should always receive final testing as [map cache files][map] loaded by MCC itself.
```

It's pretty much identical to [Halo 3 Standalone][H3-Standalone-build] so please refer to that page for further info on hotkeys and features.
