            Used for weapons like the oddball and flag which technically count
            as a third carried weapon, despite the game having a soft limit of
            2 held weapons (scripts and mods aside).

            Causes the weapon to explode using its [item][] _detonation effect_
            after being dropped. This is used to make the singleplayer fuel rod
            gun and energy sword explode when the enemies who carry them die.

      md: The maximum target distance for magnetism to apply.
    - name: deviation angle
      md: >
        Used for vehicle weapons to control the maximum angle of deviation when
        the aiming direction does not match the direction the weapon is facing.
        For example, the Ghost's deviation angle of 45 degrees allows the driver
        to fire in the direction they are aiming even if the Ghost has not yet
        turned to face that direction. Compare this to the Warthog gun's tighter
        10 degree limit.

            Affects how many projectiles are produced by a single shot. For example,

            Floor value for error angle. Even if the minimum error angle

        - name: error angle
          md: >
            Determines the minimum and maximum angle of the "error cone". The
            min angle is for when you begin firing, while the max is reached after
            a period of sustained fire. The values are shown in degrees in
            Guerilla, but internally stored in radians. Note that these fields
            receives [hard-coded singleplayer adjustments][tool#hardcoded-tag-patches]
