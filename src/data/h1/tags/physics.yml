        A coefficient which modifies the amount of friction applied to the vehicle
        when colliding with "ground" surfaces, which may just mean any BSP surface
        which is not a water plane. It is unknown if this also modifies friction
        on scenery collisions. A typical value from the Warthog is 0.23.

        Used to determine how steep of a surface the vehicle can climb before its
        powered mass points no longer have an effect. A typical value is ~0.7,
        while a value near 1.0 allows vertical climbing assuming sufficient friction.

        This is also used to determine how steep of a surface the vehicle can
        climb and seems to be some sort of lower range bound for fading out
        powered mass points. A typical value is ~0.5, with -1.0 allowing vertical
        wall climbing.
