            Determines if the volume behind (anti-normal to) this fog plane is a "water fog volume",
            which causes it to be considered underwater. This affects vehicles'
            ability to travel over water.
        - name: atmosphere dominant
          md: |
            As documented in [Guerilla][], this was originally used to fix polygon
            popping when atmospheric fog density reached 1.0 within the confines
            of the map and interacted with fog planes. It is only enabled in c10's
            swamp fog tag on both Xbox and PC. This flag is possibly changing fog
            render order and therefore also coincidentally fixes the shader
            inconsistency between Xbox and PC which causes the Assault on the Control Room
            snowy fog to look incorrect on PC.

          md: Unknown purpose. This flag was not set in any original Halo maps.
    - name: maximum density
      md: >
        Scales how dense the fog is at its opaque distance and depth,
        where `1` is the fully opaque _color_ and `0` is transparent.
    - name: opaque distance
      md: >
        The distance from the player where the fog reaches its _maximum density_.
    - name: opaque depth
      md: >
        The distance from the fog plane where the fog reaches its _maximum density_.

        Sets the colour of the screen layer volumetrics particles. Note that this
        effect only works on the original Xbox version of the game.

        This is used for underwater areas.
