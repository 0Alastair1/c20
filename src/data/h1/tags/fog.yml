            Determines if the volume behind (anti-normal to) this fog plane is a "water fog volume",
            which causes it to be considered underwater. This affects vehicles'
            ability to travel over water.

            If enabled, this flag is _meant_ to cause [sky fog][sky] to draw over
            fog planes that this tag is used on. However, the behaviour is actually
            flipped in the PC ports due to a bug. This is what results in the
            _Assault on the Control Room_ fog looking incorrect. The mod _Chimera_
            can correct this bug in-engine, or you can set the flag to be the opposite
            of what you want.
