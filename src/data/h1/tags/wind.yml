    Describes the speed and variation of wind in a
    [BSP cluster][scenario_structure_bsp#clusters-and-cluster-data], affecting
    local [point_physics][] like [flags][flag] and [weather][weather_particle_system].

        Upper and lower bounds for wind speed. Technically, this is not a true
        "velocity" because it is not a vector; wind direction is set in the BSP's
        weather palettes.
