        - name: does not hurt owner

        - name: can cause headshots
          md: >
            If enabled, any headshot against an unshielded enemy will kill it
            regardless of the amount of damage inflicted. Even a 1-damage pistol
            still instantly kills a Hunter because of this flag. This effect applies
            even after shields have been reduced to 0 by the damage effect. For
            example, even though the pistol deals 25 damage and players have 75
            shield vitality, if the final shot is a headshot the player is still
            killed because they are now unshielded.
