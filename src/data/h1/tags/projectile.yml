            The detonation timer begins immediately after the projectile is created,
            causing it to explode after a fixed length of time.

        - name: when at rest
          md: >
            Once the projectile comes to rest, its detonation timer begins.
            If it becomes in motion again, the timer is not interrupted.

        Determines the maximum range that the projectile travels in the air and
        scales _impact damage_ between its lower and upper bound. When the
        projectile reaches the maximum range, it disappears (and does not detonate).
        If detonation at a max range is desired, used the _maximum range_ field
        above. See the [impact damage formula][damage_effect#impact-damage-formula]
        for more information. If these values are set to 0, maximum damage is
        applied and the projectile continues traveling until colliding or detonating.
