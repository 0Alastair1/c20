            When choosing a random colour between _color lower bounds_ and
            _color upper bounds_, interpolate in HSV space rather than RGB.
            The interpolation will happen along the shortest hue distance.

            When _interpolate color in hsv_ is set, this causes interpolation
            to happen along the longer hue distance. For example, instead
            of interpolating orange between red and yellow, it will select
            random colors among purples, blues, and greens.

            The decal will be clipped at the edges of the underlying geometry
            rather than wrap around (neither convex nor concave).

            A lower bound for color that will be multiplied with the decal.
            Defaults to white. The color will be selected at random between
            this and the upper bound.

            Controls how long it takes for the decal to fade out at the end of
            its lifetime. This does not extend the lifetime, but rather the
            decal begins fading out this many seconds before it will expire.
