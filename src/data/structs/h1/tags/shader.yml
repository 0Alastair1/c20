            Causes [lightmap](~scenario_structure_bsp#lightmaps) UVs for this
            material to be based on existing texture UVs rather than generated
            completely anew by Tool/Sapien. This can be used to fix squiggly or
            jagged shadowing artifacts often seen on large complex surfaces
            using a single material.

            Note that any overlapping UV faces may cause lighting artifacts
            because one part of the lightmap texture is being used to represent
            different locations.

            Lighting will ignore surface normals (the direction faces point).
            Use this for shaders where the surface normals are not a good
            representation of lighting directionality, such as foliage mapped to
            flat planes for trees and bushes.

            The surface will receive the highest possible quality of lightmaps.
            Shadows will be sharper and there will be greater detail in local
            variations in lighting.

            Use this for shaders which will be used in areas which do not need
            detailed shadows or the player is unlikely to visit in order to save
            texture space.
