            A coefficient which modifies the amount of friction applied to the
            vehicle when colliding with "ground" surfaces, which may just mean
            any BSP surface which is not a water plane. It is unknown if this
            also modifies friction on scenery collisions. A typical value from
            the Warthog is 0.23.

            Used to determine how steep of a surface the vehicle can climb
            before its powered mass points no longer have an effect. A typical
            value is ~0.7, while a value near 1.0 allows vertical climbing
            assuming sufficient friction.

            This is also used to determine how steep of a surface the vehicle
            can climb and seems to be some sort of lower range bound for fading
            out powered mass points. A typical value is ~0.5, with -1.0 allowing
            vertical wall climbing.
