            This block has positional entries for every hard-coded material
            type. These are the same material types seen in [damage_effect][]
            modifiers.

                The effect to locally spawn at the interaction/collision point,
                which can do things like create decals, particles, lights, etc.

                A sound to play at the interaction/collision point. It is also
                possible to add a sound _part_ to the effect above, but using
                this field may prevent the game from cutting this sound during
                effect-intense scenes.
