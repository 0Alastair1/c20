            Determines if the volume behind (anti-normal to) this fog plane is a "water fog volume",
            which causes it to be considered underwater. This affects vehicles'
            ability to travel over water.
        - name: atmosphere dominant
          en: >
            As documented in [Guerilla][], this was originally used to fix polygon
            popping when atmospheric fog density reached 1.0 within the confines
            of the map and interacted with fog planes. It is only enabled in c10's
            swamp fog tag on both Xbox and PC. This flag is possibly changing fog
            render order and therefore also coincidentally fixes the shader
            inconsistency between Xbox and PC which causes the Assault on the Control Room
            snowy fog to look incorrect on PC.

    - name: maximum density
      en: >
        Scales how dense the fog is at its opaque distance and depth,
        where `1` is the fully opaque _color_ and `0` is transparent.
    - name: opaque distance
      en: >
        The distance from the player where the fog reaches its _maximum density_.
    - name: opaque depth
      en: >
        The distance from the fog plane where the fog reaches its _maximum density_.
