        Tracks can be considered the "layers" of the *sound_looping*. Although
        many tracks can be added, the engine is not be capable of playing more
        than 4 of each [sound class][sound#tag-field-sound-class] simultaneously
        when on high sound quality setting (2 on low or in Sapien). Extra tracks
        past these limits will not be played.
